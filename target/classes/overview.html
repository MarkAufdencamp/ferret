	<h3 id="#about">About</h3>

	Ferret is a class path scanning API for the Java platform. Unlike
	previous class path scanning APIs, Ferret does not restrict scanning to
	only certain types or force developers to learn a complicated and
	constricting query language. Instead, Ferret applies the
	<code>Visitor[GoF]</code>
	pattern to allow developers to quickly develop powerful filters that
	can scan for anything (e.g. properties files, xml, images, video, etc).
	Ferret even allows developers to modify files (including Java class
	files) on the fly. It can also scan for files and classes across the
	network. The fact that Ferret is lightweight, dynamic, fast and easy to
	use is just icing on the cake. ;-)

	<h3 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h3>

	Scanning is a four step process:

	<ol>
		<li>Create a scanner.</li>
		<li>Determine which paths you would like to scan and add them to
			the scanner.</li>
		<li>Create a filter based on your search criteria.</li>
		<li>Scan the paths using your filter to get results.</li>
	</ol>

	Here is a code example that scan's Bob's home directory to find all of
	the subdirectories.

	<pre>
		Scanner ferret = new Scanner();
		
		//Add Bob's home directory to the scan path.
		ferret.add("/home/bob");
		
		Set&lt;PathElement&gt; subdirs = ferret.scan(new ScanFilter() {

			public boolean accept(PathElement resource)
			{
				//We only care about directories
				return resource instanceof Directory;
			}
		});
	</pre>

	Scanners are stateful and maintain a list of locations that will be
	scanned when the scan method is called. If we wanted to scan Susan and
	Laura's home directories for .png images, we could do so like this:

	<pre>
		Scanner ferret = new Scanner();
		
		//Add home directories to the scan path.
		ferret.add("/home/susan");
		ferret.add("/home/laura");
		
		//Alternatively add both using var args
		ferret.add("/home/susan", "/home/laura");
		
		Set&lt;PathElement&gt; images = ferret.scan(new ScanFilter() {

			public boolean accept(PathElement resource)
			{
				//We only care about png files
				return resource.getName().endsWith(".png");
			}
		});
	</pre>

	Of course, you can delete or modify resources on the fly as part of the
	scanning process. Here's an example that deletes all of the Excel
	spread sheets from Cyril's home directory:

	<pre>
		Scanner ferret = new Scanner();
		
		//Add home directory to the scan path.
		ferret.add("/home/cyril");
		
		Set&lt;PathElement&gt; deletedFiles = ferret.scan(new ScanFilter() {

			public boolean accept(PathElement resource)
			{
				//Delete any file that ends with .xls
				if(resource instanceof File && resource.getName().endsWith(".xls"))
				{
					File deleted = (File) resouce;
					
					deleted.getFile().delete(); 
				}
				
				return false;
			}
		});
	</pre>

	<h3 id="classpath">Classpath Scanning:</h3>

	Scanning for Java class files is the same as scanning for any other
	type of file except that the type will be
	<code>ClassFile.</code>
	The
	<code>ClassFile</code>
	class allows you to manipulate the byte code immediately and directly
	using javassist.

	<pre>
		Scanner ferret = new Scanner();
		
		//Add home directory to the scan path.
		ferret.add("/home/karen");
		
		Set&lt;PathElement&gt; classFiles = ferret.scan(new ScanFilter() {

			public boolean accept(PathElement resource)
			{	
				return resource instanceof ClassFile;
			}
		});
	</pre>

	<h3 id="war">Scanning inside of a Web Application (WAR)</h3>

	Scanning inside a Java web application uses WebScanner instead of
	Scanner so that the core of Ferret will not be dependent on the servlet
	API. Otherwise, scanning inside a web app is exactly the same as
	scanning anywhere else:

	<pre>
		WebScanner ferret = new WebScanner();
		
		//Add home directory to the scan path.
		ferret.add("/WEB-INF/classes");
		
		Set&lt;PathElement&gt; propFiles = ferret.scan(new ScanFilter() {

			public boolean accept(PathElement resource)
			{	
				return resource.getName().endsWith(".properties");
			}
		});
	</pre>

	<h3 id="network">Scanning across the network</h3>

	Scanning across a network is the same as scanning a local file system.
	As long as Java knows how to handle the URL through a registered
	URLStreamHandler, you can scan files across any protocol. Simply add
	the URL to the scanner like this:

	<pre>
		scanner.add(new URL("http://myserver/myjarfile.jar"));
	</pre>

	NOTE: Sometimes network resources are not available.
	If a network path cannot be reached, an instance of
	<code>ScanException</code>
	will be thrown.

	<h3 id="archives">Dealing with Archives</h3>

	Ferret knows how to handle JAR, ZIP, EAR, WAR and SAR files based on
	the file extension. Entries inside an archive will be exposed as
	<code>ArchiveEntry</code>
	unless they are a Java class file in which case the type will be
	<code>ClassFile.</code>

	<h3 id="prefilter">Using a Prefilter</h3>

	A Prefilter restricts what paths are actually allowed to be added to
	the scanner. The default prefilter only allows local resources (i.e.
	resources on the local file system) to be added if they actually exist.
	If you need to change this behavior to modify which paths can/cannot be
	added to a scanner, you can do so using the prefilter mechanism.
